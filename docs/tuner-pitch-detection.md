# Tuner pitch detection 

Recommendation: McLeod Pitch Method via `pitchy`

**Use a ready, published algorithm and a maintained implementation. Don't keep our own.**

- **Algorithm: MPM** (McLeod & Wyvill, *A Smarter Way to Find Pitch*, 2005). It is the
  method the most credible browser-tuner write-up (29a.ch) is built on, and it is
  purpose-designed for continuous pitch of monophonic *musical* sound.
- **Library: `pitchy`** (`ianprime0509/pitchy`) — a small, tested MPM implementation that
  returns `[pitch, clarity]`. This replaces `pitchDetect.ts` for the live path.

Why MPM specifically fits a violin tuner:

- It runs in real time at 44.1/48 kHz and, unlike many detectors, **uses no low-pass
  filtering**, so it copes with the strong high harmonics of a violin instead of being
  confused by them.
- Its **clarity** measure is a single, comparable 0..1 confidence — exactly the gate the
  old doc was trying to reconstruct from RMS + thresholds.

YIN is a legitimate alternative (it's a close cousin — CMNDF vs MPM's NSDF), and our
existing code works. But there's no upside to maintaining hand-rolled DSP when a tested
MPM library exists, and MPM's clarity output simplifies the gating layer.

### `pitchy` — library audit + verdict

I checked the library against the things that actually matter for adopting a dependency
here. **Verdict: yes, use it for the live path.**

| Criterion | `pitchy` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Algorithm | MPM (McLeod 2005) | exactly the method we want |
| License | **0BSD** | most permissive there is; fine for commercial use |
| Dependencies | **one: `fft.js`** | small, permissive (MIT), well-used; not "zero" but trivial |
| Types | first-class TypeScript | no `@types/*` needed |
| Format | pure ESM | fits Vite cleanly |
| Size | **~2.8 KB gzip** (8 KB min; 33 KB unpacked w/ types) | negligible next to the app |
| Popularity | ~40 k npm downloads/month | the de-facto JS MPM library; niche but established |
| Maintenance | v4.1.0 (Jan 2024); quiet since | stable finished library — but no activity in ~2 yr |
| Speed | FFT-based autocorrelation → **O(n·log n)** | faster than our O(n²) YIN double loop |

The performance line matters: `pitchy` (via its `fft.js` dependency) computes the NSDF
through an FFT (`autocorr = IFFT(|FFT(x)|²)`), so it's already the "FFT-accelerated" path
the old doc never mentioned — at 2048 it's well under a millisecond per frame.

Integration is a near drop-in for `tuner.ts` — same `Float32Array` from the analyser:

```ts
import { PitchDetector } from 'pitchy'

// once, sized to the analyser:
const detector = PitchDetector.forFloat32Array(analyser.fftSize) // 2048
detector.minVolumeDecibels = -40 // library-level silence gate (tune on test page)

// per frame (already have `buf` from analyser.getFloatTimeDomainData):
const [hz, clarity] = detector.findPitch(buf, ctx.sampleRate)
// gate: clarity >= 0.9 → trust hz; else treat as "no note"
```

Caveat worth a test-page check: `findPitch` always returns *some* `hz`; **clarity is the
real accept/reject signal** (same lesson as the old YIN `minConfidence` bug — gate on
clarity, not on the bare frequency).

### Build our own instead? (we now understand the algorithm)

Tempting, since we already have a hand-rolled YIN in the repo and now understand MPM end
to end. The honest answer: **no meaningful upside, a real downside.**

- **Accuracy: zero gain.** `pitchy` *is* MPM done correctly. Rolling our own runs the
  same math — we'd reproduce it, not improve on it.
- **Cost: we'd own it forever.** Every octave-error edge case and the FFT correctness
  become ours to maintain. The evidence is already on the table: our hand-rolled YIN
  shipped the `minConfidence` bug that caused the "only detects B4" symptom. Hand-rolled
  pitch DSP has cost us once already.
- **"Avoid a dependency" isn't a real argument here:** 2.8 KB gzipped, one tiny
  transitive dep (`fft.js`, MIT).

**Is the quiet maintenance a problem?** Last release was Jan 2024. Normally that's a
yellow flag — but here it's **neutralised by the licence + size.** pitchy is 0BSD and
~8 KB of source. If the author disappears or a bug needs fixing, we **vendor it**: copy
the source into `app/src/lib/audio/` and own it, with zero legal friction. That is the
*smart* version of "do it ourselves" — start from working, tested MPM code instead of a
blank file. So "is it maintained?" barely matters for a library this small and this
permissive.

**Commercial use: unrestricted.** 0BSD (pitchy) and MIT (`fft.js`) are both permissive —
no copyleft, no attribution-in-binary burden. Fine to ship.

**Decision: depend on `pitchy` now; keep vendoring as the escape hatch.** Don't write our
own MPM from scratch, and stop maintaining the YIN for the live path (the offline sample
CLI can keep it — see the plan below).

## Is there a more modern / better alternative? (checked May 2026)

Short answer: **no — for a solo-instrument tuner this is a solved problem, and
`pitchy`/MPM is the lean solution.** Two things confirmed by a fresh search:

**1. The browser has no native pitch-detection API.** `AnalyserNode` gives you FFT /
time-domain samples but *no* pitch — you always supply the algorithm yourself (a library
or hand-rolled). "Modern browsers solve this for you" is false: it's solved at the
*library* level, not the platform level. So the only question is *which* library.

**2. Nothing newer is both lighter and better for this job.** The field splits in three:

| Option | What it is | Verdict for our tuner |
|---|---|---|
| **`pitchy`** (MPM) | lean, tuner-focused, 2.8 KB gzip | **our pick** |
| **`pitchfinder`** | JS bag of algorithms (YIN, MPM, AMDF, wavelet), MIT | the one true peer — *same* MPM/YIN, bundled with weaker extras; fine as a fallback, not an upgrade |
| **Essentia.js / aubio** (WASM) | full MIR toolkits (incl. YIN / YinFFT), AudioWorklet-capable | overkill — hundreds of KB+ for features we don't need |
| **CREPE / SPICE** (TensorFlow.js) | neural, state-of-the-art accuracy, noise/polyphony-robust | overkill — MB-scale model download, WASM/WebGL, mobile battery + latency, a 16 kHz-resampling quirk; **no perceptible benefit on a clean solo violin** |

The "modern frontier" (CREPE 2018, SPICE 2019) is ML, and it only wins on *hard* signals
— noisy rooms, singing voice, polyphony, transcription. A single sustained violin note
into a phone mic is exactly the easy, monophonic case MPM was designed for; a neural net
buys accuracy we'd never hear, for megabytes and milliseconds we'd definitely feel.

So the algorithm question is settled, and in our favour: **YIN (2002) and MPM (2005) are
still the references for monophonic instrument tuning**, every lightweight JS library
implements one or both, and `pitchy` is the cleanest single-purpose MPM build. If `pitchy`
ever became a problem, `pitchfinder` (same algorithms, MIT) is the drop-in peer — a
sideways move, not an upgrade. There is no newer, lighter, *better* option for this job.

## How MPM works (so the settings below aren't magic numbers)

1. **NSDF** — the Normalized Square Difference Function. Plain SDF is
   `d(τ) = Σ (sᵢ − sᵢ₊τ)²`, which dips toward zero where the signal lines up with a
   delayed copy of itself. MPM normalizes it to `n(τ)` in `[-1, 1]` by dividing by the
   summed signal energy. Normalization is what makes peak heights comparable across loud
   and quiet input — and what gives a meaningful clarity number.
2. **Peak picking** — collect the maxima of `n(τ)` between its positive zero-crossings.
   Take the highest peak `nmax`, then pick the **first** peak whose height ≥ `k · nmax`.
   The constant **k = 0.93** (tunable 0.8–1.0; lower favours the lower octave). This
   "first tall-enough peak" rule is MPM's octave-error fix.
3. **Parabolic interpolation** around the chosen peak's lag → sub-sample period →
   ~1-cent frequency resolution. (Our YIN already does the equivalent.)
4. **Clarity** = the interpolated peak height of `n(τ)`, in `[0, 1]`. ~1.0 = a pure,
   confident tone; low = noise/no clear pitch. **This is the value to threshold on.**

## Concrete settings

| Setting | Value | Source / reason |
|---|---|---|
| Algorithm | **MPM** (`pitchy`) | 29a.ch; McLeod 2005; pitchy |
| Window / `fftSize` | **2048** baseline; **4096** if open-G (≈196 Hz) misreads | needs several low-string cycles; bigger = more latency/CPU |
| Sample rate | Whatever `AudioContext` gives (44.1 / 48 kHz) | MPM is real-time at both |
| MPM peak constant `k` | **0.93** | McLeod 2005 (range 0.8–1.0) |
| **Clarity** accept | start **≥ 0.9**; expose a slider on the test page | pitchy/audiojs "reliable" cutoff |
| Amplitude / RMS gate | reject silence only; **auto** = noise-floor × ~3 | keep `tuner.ts`'s adaptive floor for the silence case |
| Frequency bounds | **~180–2800 Hz** (open-G → high E positions) | clamps sub-/super-harmonic octave errors |
| Smoothing | **median of ~5** cents readings | kills per-frame jitter |
| Note hysteresis | require **~3 consecutive** frames on a note before committing | kills the octave-jump flicker |
| `getUserMedia` | DSP off: `echoCancellation`, `noiseSuppression`, `autoGainControl` false | speech DSP distorts pitch & level |
| Loop | rAF, frame work **< 16.7 ms** (60 fps) | leaves headroom on a phone |

Note ↔ Hz ↔ cents math is already correct in `tuning.ts`
(`12·log₂(f/ref)`, `cents = 1200·log₂(f/f_nearest)`) — unchanged.

### Clarity threshold by use case

The accept gate (`clarityThreshold` in `TunerSettings`) is the single MPM clarity
value a frame must clear to register as a note. Good starting ranges by signal type:

| Range | Use case | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **0.90–0.95** | Instrument tuning (guitar, violin, piano) | The "golden standard." Instruments produce clean, periodic waveforms, so clarity sits high. The MPM/Tartini work uses ~**0.93** as its baseline (see the caveat below). |
| **0.80–0.88** | Singing / human voice | Vocal cords have micro-variation, vibrato and breathiness that pull clarity below a string's. Push above ~0.88 and a sustained voice can randomly drop out mid-note. |
| **0.65–0.75** | Lenient / noisy rooms, cheap phone mics | Registers pitches through background hum, at the cost of occasionally latching onto noise as a "note." |

**Accuracy caveat on the 0.93.** That number is MPM's internal **peak-pick constant
`k`** (pick the first NSDF peak ≥ `k·nmax`), not the accept threshold — it's a
different knob in the same neighbourhood, and `pitchy` already applies it internally
at its default. Our `clarityThreshold` is the *downstream* accept gate on the returned
clarity. So treat the ranges above as practical accept-gate guidance; they're sound,
just don't conflate them with `k`.

**Why this app ships 0.60, below even the lenient range** (defaults: `sensitivity
0.9`, `clarityThreshold 0.6`)**:** the goal is that a quietly- *or* roughly-bowed
violin on a phone mic still gets tuned. In real device testing the weak strings and
off-centre bowing only cleared the gate near the slider's 0.5 minimum, and the
volume gate needed near-max sensitivity, so the defaults are deliberately permissive.
The note-confirm hysteresis (`confirmFrames`) + the 120–2800 Hz clamp do the noise
rejection the low clarity gate gives up — random noise rarely holds the same note
for several consecutive frames. The test-page sliders re-tune this per device; raise
clarity / lower sensitivity if a quiet room makes the readout twitch on noise.

### Smoothing vs. confirmation — two stages, not redundant (researched, settled)

`smoothingFrames` ("Smoothing") and `confirmFrames` ("Confirm") look similar but
stabilize **two different quantities**, and each fixes a defect the other can't.
This is standard tuner practice — confirmed by external sources (below), so it does
not need re-researching.

| Knob | Stabilizes | Defect it fixes | Standard name in the literature |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Smoothing** (`smoothingFrames`) | the **continuous cents value** — needle position *within* a note | per-frame jitter: the needle/readout twitching ±a few cents on a steadily-held note | display / pitch-contour smoothing — "smooth the display so it doesn't flash a new value every frame"; median windows are the usual tool (e.g. the *Smart-Median* real-time pitch smoother) |
| **Confirm** (`confirmFrames`) | the **discrete note label** — *which* note is shown | note flicker: a single bad frame flipping the note to an octave or neighbour | "sticky" pitch / hysteresis / debounce — "make the earlier pitch sticky so a single frame detecting a different candidate (e.g. an octave) is ignored" |

**Why neither covers the other:** the cents-smoothing window **resets on every note
change** (`tuner.ts`, `this.centsHistory = []` in `commit()`). So the two run *in
sequence*: confirmation decides *which note* first, then smoothing calms the cents
*within* that confirmed note. Smoothing therefore gives zero protection against a
note flip (the window just resets), and confirmation does nothing for cents jitter
(the note identity isn't changing). Proof by turning one off:

- `confirmFrames = 1`, smoothing high → a stray octave-error frame instantly flips
  the *note name*; smoothing can't catch it.
- `smoothingFrames = 1`, confirm high → the note label is rock-steady, but the
  *needle* stays nervous on a held note because MPM's per-frame Hz estimate has noise.

**Verdict: keep both.** They are orthogonal — Confirm = stability of *which note*,
Smoothing = stability of *how in-tune*. The only thing they share is a little added
latency, which is why the defaults are modest.

---

## Optional robustness (from 29a.ch — add only if the basics aren't enough)

These are the real-world tricks the old doc skipped. They matter most for noisy phone
mics; don't add them pre-emptively.

- **FFT-accelerated autocorrelation** — compute the difference/NSDF via FFT to drop the
  inner loop from **O(n²) → O(n·log n)**. Relevant if larger windows (4096) cost too
  much per frame. `pitchy` already handles its own cost; this matters only if we keep
  rolling our own.
- **Onset / attack locking** — take a reliable first estimate from the pluck/bow attack
  and bias toward it, instead of trusting every frame equally.
- **Kalman filter** — a principled alternative to the median window for fusing successive
  noisy estimates into a stable readout. Median + hysteresis is simpler and usually enough.
- **Off-main-thread detection** — whether to move the DSP to an `AudioWorklet` / Web
  Worker is its own question; the short answer for this workload is "not worth it yet."
  See `docs/tuner-web-workers.md` for the full reasoning.

## Plan for the implementation task

1. Add `pitchy`; replace the live detector in `tuner.ts` with MPM, gating on **clarity**
   (default ≥ 0.9) plus the existing adaptive RMS floor for silence.
2. Keep `pitchDetect.ts` (YIN) only for the offline `scripts/detect-pitch.mjs` sample
   detector — no need to touch that path.
3. On the test pages (`#/test/tuner`, `#/test/scaletuner`) expose: clarity slider,
   window 2048/4096, violin-range vs full-range, median length + frames-to-confirm, and
   a filter-off raw view. Use these to lock defaults empirically, **then** ship a tuner
   with zero sliders — just start/stop and the dial.

---

## Shipped (Task 27)

The live path now runs `pitchy` MPM; the offline sample CLI keeps YIN. Concretely:

- **`pitchy` (v4.1.0)** added to `app/package.json`. 0BSD, one tiny transitive dep
  (`fft.js`), first-class types.
- **`app/src/lib/audio/tuner.ts`** rewritten around `PitchDetector.forFloat32Array`:
  the `Tuner` class lazily builds one detector sized to the frame length (reused across
  frames, rebuilt only if the length changes), and calls `findPitch(buf, sampleRate)
  → [hz, clarity]` per frame. The hand-rolled YIN/confidence/fallback machinery is gone.
  - **Range clamp:** `hz` outside **180–2800 Hz** is treated as "no pitch" (kills
    sub-/super-harmonic octave errors). pitchy's internal `clarityThreshold` (the MPM
    peak-pick constant `k`) is left at its default; our accept gate is a *separate*
    comparison on the returned clarity.
  - **Clarity gate (filtered path):** a note is surfaced only when
    `clarity ≥ settings.clarityThreshold` (default **0.9**, `DEFAULT_CLARITY_THRESHOLD`).
    Below it → "no note", never a weak guess. There is no fallback flag anymore — clarity
    *is* the accept/reject signal.
  - **Volume gate = the single user-facing knob.** We kept the adaptive RMS noise-floor
    as the one volume gate (not pitchy's `minVolumeDecibels`, to avoid two overlapping
    gates); `sensitivity` maps it to a 6×..1.5× multiple of the floor. pitchy's
    `minVolume*` is left unset so our floor is the sole source of truth.
  - **Raw bypass** (`filterEnabled: false`) returns the bare range-clamped `findPitch`
    output, gates skipped. `clarity` is reported on *every* reading (even when gated
    out) so the test readout can show whether a frame would clear the gate.
  - Median-of-5 cents smoothing is retained as-is (proper smoothing/hysteresis is
    Task 28).
- **`TunerReading.confidence` → `clarity`** through `useMicPitch` and both test pages.
  `TunerSettings.noiseReduction` → **`clarityThreshold`**.
- **`TunerControls`** now surfaces **Herkkyys** (sensitivity, primary) + a secondary
  **Selkeysraja** clarity slider (0.5–1.0, value shown) + the filter ON/OFF toggle. Test
  readouts lead with `clarity 0.NN · …`. These control/state shapes are reusable for the
  Task 29 settings menu.
- **Offline aid:** `scripts/detect-pitch.mjs --pitchy` runs `detectPitchMPM` (exported
  from `tuner.ts` — the same MPM call as the live path, windowed for one-shot files).
  Confirmed on the shipped samples: G4 → clarity 0.90, A3 → clarity 0.95 (both correct);
  the low minor-space pad reads F1/F2 ambiguously but sits far below the 180 Hz violin
  clamp, so it never reaches the live tuner. Default YIN path unchanged.

Still manual-only: the mic/UI path (sustained violin notes across a loudness range)
must be verified in the browser on `#/test/tuner`.

---

## Shipped (Task 28) — detector-side stability

The per-frame `[hz, clarity]` from `pitchy` is steady enough to *accept*, but the
note label and cents still jumped frame-to-frame. Task 28 adds **detector-side**
smoothing + hysteresis inside the `Tuner` class — so the *reported reading*
itself is calmer, not just the dial easing on top of it. All of it sits on top of
the unchanged `pitchy` output (algorithm-agnostic).

**Three mechanisms, one small state machine** (`app/src/lib/audio/tuner.ts`):

1. **Cents smoothing** — a median over the last `smoothingFrames` cents readings
   *of the committed note* (median, not mean, so a single octave-error frame
   can't pull the value). The window resets when the note changes, so a new
   note's cents don't average against the old one. `smoothingFrames = 1` ⇒ off.
2. **Note-confirm hysteresis** — a note *different from* the committed one must
   be seen for `confirmFrames` consecutive clear frames before it replaces the
   label. This kills the brief octave-jump / neighbour-note flicker. A single
   unclear frame resets the candidate counter, so noise can't slowly accumulate
   into a false commit.
3. **Hold / decay** — once committed, a note survives `confirmFrames +
   HOLD_EXTRA_FRAMES` (8) unclear frames, re-showing its last smoothed cents,
   before it's released to "no note". This stops a sustained note flickering
   away in the inevitable gaps between clear frames (bow changes, vibrato dips).

The state (`committedMidi`, `candidateMidi`/`candidateCount`, `missCount`,
`lastCents`/`lastHz`) is cleared by `reset()` on every `start()`. The
`commit()` / `release()` split keeps each path readable.

**Defaults** (frame counts at the ~60 fps rAF rate):

| Setting | Default | ≈ time | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| `smoothingFrames` | **8** | ~130 ms | calm cents/needle without visible lag |
| `confirmFrames` | **4** | ~65 ms | steady label; still snaps to a real change fast |
| `HOLD_EXTRA_FRAMES` | 8 (internal) | ~130 ms | bridges clear-frame gaps on a held note |

These favour readability over instantaneous response, as the task asks.
`DEFAULT_SMOOTHING_FRAMES` / `DEFAULT_CONFIRM_FRAMES` are exported so Task 29 can
bake them as the zero-config production defaults.

**Reading shape.** `TunerReading` gained `rawCents` (this frame's unsmoothed
detection, `null` when nothing was detected this frame) and `held` (true when the
reading is a decayed/held note rather than a fresh detection). `detected` now
stays true across hold frames. These exist so the test readout can *prove* the
calming is the detector's: it shows `raaka +12¢→tasattu +3¢` and `pidossa` when
holding — distinguishing real detector smoothing from the CSS needle easing.

**Test-page controls.** `TunerControls` exposes the two experimental sliders —
**Tasaus** (`smoothingFrames`, 1–`SMOOTHING_FRAMES_MAX`) and **Sävelvarmistus**
(`confirmFrames`, 1–`CONFIRM_FRAMES_MAX`) — alongside the existing
Herkkyys/Selkeysraja knobs. Both test pages (`#/test/tuner`, `#/test/scaletuner`)
seed their state from `DEFAULT_TUNER_SETTINGS` and pass the values live through
`useMicPitch` (no detector restart — settings flow via the existing ref). The
control + state shapes are deliberately reusable for the Task 29 settings menu
(presets + saved custom + reset).

**Dial timing.** `TunerDial`'s 100 ms `transition-transform` on the needle was
left unchanged: with the now-calmer ~50 ms-throttled readings it eases gently and
*supports* the stabilised value instead of reintroducing nervous motion. A held
note simply freezes the needle at its last cents — no extra animation logic.

Manual validation (browser, sustained violin): note label, cents, and needle are
noticeably calmer at the defaults; a genuine pitch change still commits within a
practical tuning latency (~65 ms + smoothing).

## Production filter — one "Mittausnopeus" slider, permissive gating (Tasks 29, 31)

The test-page `TunerControls` expose four independent knobs (Herkkyys/sensitivity,
Selkeysraja/clarity, Tasaus/smoothing, Sävelvarmistus/confirm). That is right for
*finding* defaults but wrong for players. For the production screen
(`SimpleTunerControls`) we collapse them to a single **3-step slider**
(**Mittausnopeus** — "measurement speed"), and the mapping is chosen deliberately,
not just for fewer widgets.

**The old "Filter ON" felt worse because it conflated two unrelated jobs:**

1. **Gating** — `sensitivity` (volume floor) + `clarityThreshold` (tone-quality
   floor) *reject* frames. Too aggressive ⇒ real notes get dropped ⇒ the needle
   goes dead. A violin into a phone mic is a rough signal (bow noise, room, mic
   AGC), so its clarity number runs lower than a clean studio tone — a high
   `clarityThreshold` rejects perfectly good playing. This is what made
   "filter on" measurably worse than "filter off" in informal testing.
2. **Smoothing** — `smoothingFrames` / `confirmFrames` only *slow/calm* the
   reading (see Task 28 above). They never reject a note; worst case is a slightly
   laggy needle, never a dead one.

**Decision:** the 3-step slider drives **only the smoothing stage**, and never
re-tightens gating. So every step still sees every note — higher steps are just
calmer/steadier, not pickier. Concretely:

| Slider | smoothing/confirm | sensitivity | clarityThreshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** Nopea (fast/responsive) | minimal (≈ off) | **max** | 0.5 (locked) |
| **2** default (measured sweet spot) | 5 / 4 | **max** | 0.5 (locked) |
| **3** Hidas (slow/steady) | 12 / 7 | **max** | 0.5 (locked) |

- **`sensitivity` is pinned at max** at every step — we want to hear quiet notes;
  the volume floor was never the thing that helped.
- **`clarityThreshold` is locked at 0.5** (measured best on a real phone + violin,
  2026-06-06), not ramped. The slider means "how calm," not "how picky". The locked
  value dropped from the initial 0.6 to 0.5 after the device sweep showed that 0.5
  clears on weak strings and off-centre bowing without false positives.
- **Default = step 2:** the measured sweet spot — smoothing 5 / confirm 4 —
  noticeably calmer than raw, still responsive. The user can slide on the phone to
  taste; the result persists (`tunerStore`).

Net: the worst case is a slightly jumpy-but-accurate needle, never a silent one —
the failure mode that actually hurt before.
